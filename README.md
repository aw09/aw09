### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
##### Thank you for visiting my github :satisfied: <br>
I am a final year student of informatics engineering. I am curious about anything related to technology :computer:<br/>I did an internship as a *backend developer*, but now I'm trying to explore Front End and *Machine Learning*. I'm also interested in the stock market and I'm doing my own research using **Python**, hopefully applying machine learning to the stock market. 



You can also connect with me in other social media <br/>
